/**
 * \ingroup aggregator
 * \brief Collector which sums all the input data and emits the sum as a single
 *        scalar output value.
 *
 * ### Input ###
 * This class provides 5 trace sinks for receiving inputs. Each trace sink
 * is a function with a signature similar to the following:
 * \code
 *   void TraceSinkP (P oldData, P newData);
 * \endcode
 * where `P` is one of the 5 supported data types. This type of signature
 * follows the trace source signature types commonly exported by probes. The
 * input data is processed using either `double` (the default) or `uint64_t`
 * data types, depending on the input data type selected by calling the
 * SetInputDataType() method or setting the `InputDataType` attribute.
 *
 * ### Processing ###
 * This class sums all the received input values. The operation utilized to sum
 * those values is by default a simple addition operation. Additional operation,
 * such as averaging, may be specified by calling the the SetOutputType() method
 * or setting the `OutputType` attribute. For boolean data type, a `true` value
 * is regarded as 1, while a `false` value is regarded as 0.
 *
 * ### Output ###
 * At the end of the instance's life (e.g., when the simulation ends), the
 * `Output` trace source is fired to export the output. It contains a single
 * value in `double` type carrying the sum accumulated during the simulation.
