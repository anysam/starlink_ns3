/**
 * \ingroup aggregator
 * \brief Collector which computes the value distribution of the input samples.
 *
 * ### Input ###
 * This class provides 9 trace sinks for receiving inputs. Each trace sink
 * is a function with a signature similar to the following:
 * \code
 *   void TraceSinkP (P oldData, P newData);
 * \endcode
 * where `P` is one of the 9 supported data types. This type of signature
 * follows the trace source signature types commonly exported by probes.
 * Although different data types are accepted, they are all internally
 * processed using `double` data type.
 *
 * ### Processing ###
 * This class begins by setting up a set of _bins_. Each bin covers an equal
 * length of input value range which does not overlap with the range of other
 * bins. Each received input sample is categorized into exactly one of these
 * bins. In this case, that bin's counter is increased by one. At the end of
 * the simulation, the bins would represent the distribution information of all
 * the received samples.
 *
 * The setup of the bins can be configured through the `NumOfBins` attribute.
 * The corresponding method SetNumOfBins() can also be used for the same
 * purpose.
 *
 * The class will compute a prediction of range of the bins based on the first
 * 1000 samples received (see ns3::AdaptiveBins). Any subsequent samples which
 * do not fit into the predicted range are handled as follows.
 * - Input values which are less than lower bound of the first bin are
 *   categorized into the first bin.
 * - Input values which are equal or greater than upper bound of the last bin
 *   are categorized into the last bin.
 *
 * ### Output ###
 * At the end of the instance's life (e.g., when the simulation ends), the
 * `Output` trace source is fired, typically several times in a row, to export
 * the output. Each time the trace source is fired, it contains the bin
 * identifier (i.e., the center value of the bin) and the corresponding value
 * of that bin. The bin value is determined by the selected output type, which
 * can be modified by calling the SetOutputType() method or setting the
 * `OutputType` attribute. The burst of output is guaranteed to be in order
 * from the first bin (the lowest identifier) until the last bin.
 *
 * In addition, the class also computes several statistical information and
 * export them as output trace sources.
 * - `OutputCount`
 * - `OutputSum`
 * - `OutputMin`
 * - `OutputMax`
 * - `OutputMean`
 * - `OutputStddev`
 * - `OutputVariance`
 * - `OutputSqrSum`
 *
 * Finally, when the OUTPUT_TYPE_CUMULATIVE is selected as the output type, the
 * class also includes percentile information in the following trace sources.
 * - `Output5thPercentile`
 * - `Output25thPercentile`
 * - `Output50thPercentile`
 * - `Output75thPercentile`
 * - `Output95thPercentile`
 * Note that linear interpolation is used to calculate these percentile
 * information, and thus might have some errors.
 *
 * All the additional statistical and percentile trace sources mentioned above
 * are also emitted in string format through the `OutputString` trace source.
 * The resulting string also includes the parameters used to collect the
 * samples. Example `OutputString` output:
 * \code
 * % min_value: 0
 * % max_value: 1
 * % bin_length: 0.02
 * % num_of_bins: 50
 * % output_type: 'OUTPUT_TYPE_CUMULATIVE'
 * % count: 9
 * % sum: 4.40882
 * % min: 0.258985
 * % max: 1.29714
 * % mean: 0.489869
 * % stddev: 0.457671
 * % variance: 0.209463
 * % sqr_sum: 3.83545
 * % percentile_5: 0.2315
 * % percentile_25: 0.2375
 * % percentile_50: 0.245
 * % percentile_75: 0.265
 * % percentile_95: 0.9855
