/**
 * \ingroup aggregator
 * \brief Collector which partitions the simulation into fixed length time
 *        intervals and produce the sum of input sample data during each
 *        interval as output.
 *
 * ### Input ###
 * This class provides 5 trace sinks for receiving inputs. Each trace sink
 * is a function with a signature similar to the following:
 * \code
 *   void TraceSinkP (P oldData, P newData);
 * \endcode
 * where `P` is one of the 5 supported data types. This type of signature
 * follows the trace source signature types commonly exported by probes. The
 * input data is processed using either `double` (the default) or `uint64_t`
 * data types, depending on the input data type selected by calling the
 * SetInputDataType() method or setting the `InputDataType` attribute.
 *
 * ### Processing ###
 * Upon created, this class instance begins an interval. It lasts for a fixed
 * time duration (one second by default) that can be specified by calling the
 * SetIntervalLength() method or setting the `IntervalLength` attribute. The
 * instance accumulates the received input during the interval into a summed
 * value. Then at the end of each interval, the summed value is emitted as
 * output and reset back to zero. For boolean data type, a `true` value is
 * regarded as 1, while a `false` value is regarded as 0.
 *
 * ### Output ###
 * Samples received are *consolidated* using one of 3 available ways (e.g., sum,
 * count, average). It can be selected by calling the SetOutputType() method or
 * setting the `OutputType` attribute.
 *
 * After that, this class utilizes 3 trace sources to export the output:
 * - `OutputWithoutTime`: the consolidated value from an interval, emitted at
 *   the end of every interval.
 * - `OutputWithTime`: the interval's ending time and its consolidated value,
 *   emitted at the end of every interval.
 * - `OutputOverall`: the consolidated value from all intervals, emitted when
 *   the instance is destroyed.
 * The consolidated values are exported in `double` data type in the same unit
 * as the inputs. The time information is exported in unit of seconds by
 * default, or as specified otherwise by calling the SetTimeUnit() method or
 * setting the `TimeUnit` attribute.
 *
 * In addition, the class also exports the total number of input samples
 * received during the simulation as the `OutputCount` trace source. The same
 * information is also available from the `OutputString` trace source, which
 * has an output similar to the following:
 * \code
 * % output_type: 'OUTPUT_TYPE_SUM'
 * % count: 57
 * % sum: 672.72
 * \endcode
 * These two trace sources are exported at the end of simulation.
