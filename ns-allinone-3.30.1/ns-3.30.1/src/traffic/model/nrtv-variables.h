 * \ingroup nrtv
 * \brief Container of various random variables for assisting the generation of
 *        streaming traffic pattern by the Near Real-Time Video (NRTV) traffic
 *        model.
 *
 * The default configuration of some of the underlying random distributions are
 * according to NGMN [1] and WiMAX [2] specifications.
 *
 * The available random values to be retrieved are:
 * - number of frames per video --- truncated LogNormal distribution with mean
 *   of 3000 frames (i.e., 5 minutes of 10 fps video);
 * - frame interval --- constant 100 ms (i.e., 10 fps);
 * - number of slices per frame --- constant 8 slices (packets);
 * - slice size --- truncated Pareto distribution with mean of approximately
 *   82.64 bytes;
 * - slice encoding delay --- truncated Pareto distribution with mean of
 *   approximately 5.31 ms;
 * - client's de-jitter buffer window size --- constant 5 seconds; and
 * - client's idle time --- unbounded exponential distribution with mean of
 *   5 seconds.
 *
 * Most parameters of the random distributions are configurable via attributes
 * and methods of this class.
