   *               destination client) that will be utilized by the worker to
   *               send video packets
   *
   * The worker will determine the length of video using NrtvVariables class.
   * Other variables are also retrieved from this class, such as number of
   * frames per second (frame rate) and number of slices per frame.
   *
   * The first video frame starts once the server has given a permission to do so.
   * Each frame has a fixed number of slices, and each slice is preceded by a
   * random length of encoding delay. Each slice constitutes a single packet,
   * which size is also determined randomly. Each packet begins with a 24-byte
   * NrtvHeader.
   *
   * Each frame always abides to the given frame rate, i.e., the start of each
   * frame is always punctual according to the frame rate. If the transmission
   * of the slices takes longer than the length of a single frame, then the
   * remaining unsent slices would be discarded, without postponing the start
   * time of the next frame.
   *
   * Each slice sent will invoke the callback function specified using
   * SetTxCallback(). After all the frames have been transmitted, another
   * callback function, specified using SetVideoCompletedCallback(), will be
   * invoked.
