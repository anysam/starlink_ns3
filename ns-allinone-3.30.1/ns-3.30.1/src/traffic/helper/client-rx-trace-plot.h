/**
 * \ingroup applications
 * \brief Installed on an application with "Rx" trace source, this helper class will
 *        generate a Gnuplot file out of the Rx traffic experienced by the
 *        application.
 *
 * One helper is intended only for one application and will generate one Gnuplot
 * file at the end of the simulation. Usage example:
 *
 *     Ptr<PacketSink> packetSink = apps.Get (0);
 *     Ptr<ClientTracePlot> plot =
 *         CreateObject<ClientTracePlot> (packetSink);
 *
 * By default, the Gnuplot file name is "client-trace.plt". This can be
 * modified by calling the SetOutputName() method, or by using the extended
 * constructor.
 *
 * The Gnuplot file can be converted to a PNG file, for example by using this
 * command:
 *
 *     $ gnuplot client-trace.plt
 *
 * The above command generates a new file "client-trace.png" in the same
 * directory.
